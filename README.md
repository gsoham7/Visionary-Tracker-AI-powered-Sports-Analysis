# Visionary-Tracker-AI-powered-Sports-Analysis
This research presents an AI-powered sports analysis system capable of tracking players, analyzing gameplay, and providing performance insights across multiple sports. The integration of deep learning models such as YOLO and ByteTrack enables real-time object detection and tracking, while machine learning techniques enhance predictive analytics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, achieving high accuracy in football, tennis, badminton, and pool/snooker analysis, while the basketball classification model achieved perfect predictive performance. However, the system does not provide real-time updates or store new analysis results; instead, it serves as a foundation for sports analysts and developers to use the provided code for their own research and development. Future improvements should focus on dataset diversity, occlusion handling, and real-time inference optimization. Enhancing tracking algorithms, integrating multi-angle video feeds, and incorporating wearable sensor data will further refine the systemâ€™s capabilities. This research contributes to the advancement of AI-driven sports analytics and opens new possibilities for automated performance evaluation in competitive sports.
